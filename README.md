This repository contains the code for the experiments in the paper *Improving the convergence of Markov chains via permutations and projections*. We compare standard Metropolis-Hastings samplers with projection samplers on three models:

- Ising model on the line
- Edwards-Anderson spin glass
- Blume-Capel model

We thank Zheyuan Lai for computational assistance.
